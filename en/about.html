      <hr>
      <h4>2025 - Present</h4>
      <p>
        At <strong>Integral Massage Therapy (TIM)</strong>, we are exclusively dedicated to physical and emotional well-being through a wide variety of therapies. With over 8 years of experience, we have established ourselves as a reference center for professional massages in Recoleta.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that taking care of the body is essential for a fulfilling life. That is why we have a team of highly trained therapists committed to offering a personalized and quality experience. For us, health is the foundation of daily well-being, and we reflect that in every session.
      </p>
    
      
      <p>
        Thanks to the love and trust of our clients, we have experienced constant and sustained growth. Your support is what drives us to keep improving every day!
      </p>
    
      <h4>2019 - 2022</h4>
      <p>
        Despite the challenges brought by the pandemic, TIM stood strong thanks to the unconditional support of those who choose us year after year. These years strengthened us as a team and as a supportive space.
      </p>
    
      <h4>2017 - Opening of the center</h4>
      <p>
        We opened our doors in September 2017, at Ayacucho 1250, Recoleta. Since then, hundreds of people have trusted us to improve their quality of life through the power of therapeutic massage.
